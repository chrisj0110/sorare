# Sorare lineup helper

This was built for fun to help with filling out NBA lineups on [sorare.com](https://sorare.com/nba/play), an NFT game. It was last used in January 2024 and has surely become outdated and/or broken since then.

It uses the sorare api to pull players, stats, upcoming games, etc, and runs simulations to predict who will perform well, outputting everything into a csv that the user can use to fill out lineups. It also scrapes ESPN to show latest injury information.
